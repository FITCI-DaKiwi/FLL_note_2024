### [Pybricks for FLL Teams: One-year review](https://github.com/orgs/pybricks/discussions/1329)

FLL Team 24277 from Norfolk used Pybricks with Spike Prime robots for the 2023 season, finding it reliable and accurate. They created a BaseRobot class to simplify motor and sensor setups and used VS Code and GitHub for collaboration. Minor issues included occasional hub reboots and a quick auto-shutdown feature, but these didn’t affect overall performance. The coach felt that while Lego’s block coding could achieve similar functionality, Pybricks made code sharing much easier. Pybricks is recommended for teams with some Python experience and motivated students but may not be suitable for all.
