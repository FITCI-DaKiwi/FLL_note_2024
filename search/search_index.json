They created a BaseRobot class to simplify motor and sensor setups and used VS Code and GitHub for collaboration. Minor issues included occasional hub reboots and a quick auto-shutdown feature, but these didn\u2019t affect overall performance. The coach felt that while Lego\u2019s block coding could achieve similar functionality, Pybricks made code sharing much easier. Pybricks is recommended for teams with some Python experience and motivated students but may not be suitable for all.
